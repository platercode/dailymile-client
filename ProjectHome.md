I created this project as a simple Java client library that can be used to interact with the dailymile (http://www.dailymile.com/) API.  For more information about dailymile's API visit  http://www.dailymile.com/api.


NOTE:  This project is just starting out, see the [Getting Started wiki](http://code.google.com/p/dailymile-client/wiki/GettingStarted) for what can be accomplished so far.

If you have any questions or suggestions please use the issue section or send an email to group email addres: dailymile-client@googlegroups.com


First release is complete - I haven't done a bunch of testing but I wanted to get the first version out there.  Currently the only way to get it is to download the jar from this site (or build it from the source code).


**UPDATE** (1/25/2012)
I am thinking of updating this project to the new dailymile API changes and to add more export/import functionality.  Let me know if there is anything you would like to see added!
