# download dailymile-cli-2.1.jar from the download page
# retrieve your oauth token as follows:
## go to https://api.dailymile.com/oauth/authorize?response_type=token&client_id=pMy0L5dQOE5E3m1nUc4c5VlcS0Cgmz3aya6erjKx&redirect_uri=www.dailymile.com
## enter login information (if prompted) and then allow access for "Plater's Code Bulk Import"
## you will be redirected to an invalid page, that is expected.  Grab the oauth token from the url (it's the long string after access_token=).  You will need this later
# from a command prompt (such as cmd or cygwin on windows) run the executable jar.  Below is an example run with <...> indicating where you need to provide information.  You can skip the first two prompts since I provided the oauth url above.
